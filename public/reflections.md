<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="0" data-line-end="1"><strong>List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="4">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3"><strong>Variable Declaration</strong> - Similarly to C++, declaring/creating variables can be done by simply typing a keyword such as let or var, and adding the name and value of the variable right after, an example of which would be “let x = 5”. Since Javascript is a more dynamic coding language, there is no need to specifiy the variable type, as it is already done for you.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="6">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5"><strong>Comparison Operations</strong> - These operations are nearly the same as in C++, with the only new addition being the strictly equal and strictly not equal symbol, denoted by 3 equal signs and an exclamation mark and 2 equal signs respectively. They are used in logical operations to compare the value and type of 2 variables, so the expression of (5 === “5”) would return false due to different variable types.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="8">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7"><strong>Loop Control Structures</strong> - These statements are used to repeat certain actions until a desired outcome is met. The 2 main types are for statements and while statements, with for statements being used when the number of iterations is already known, and while statements being used when the number of iterations is not known. There are also statements which can disrupt the loop, such as continue statements, which skip the current iteration, and break statements, which end the whole loop early.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="10">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9"><strong>Arithmetic Operators</strong> - These operations are exactly the same as in C++, with little to no difference. They function by putting them next to or in between variables to perform the desired operation such as multiplying, subtracting, and adding.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="16">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="11"><strong>Functions</strong> - Functions are the most important aspect to coding, as it allows for certain chunks of code to be declared when needed, instead of having to be rewritten every time. Some functions are pre-built into C++ and can be called anytime, such as alert() and console.log(), but custom ones can also be created using the format below, and can be declared by calling the function name, followed by a set of parenthesis where the custom values for each input variable are set. (Ex. add(5,6) )</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="12" data-line-end="16"><strong>function</strong> name(input variables){<br>
code<br>
return variable;<br>
}&quot;</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="21" data-line-end="22"><strong>List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="22" data-line-end="24">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="22" data-line-end="23"><strong>Logical Operators</strong> - I understand this lesson for the most part, but I still don’t get how each logical operation works when using non boolean variables, and what the output would be.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="24" data-line-end="25">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="24" data-line-end="25"><strong>Event Handlers</strong> -  Since we didn’t discuss the lesson that thoroughly, I still feel like I need more practice.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="25" data-line-end="26">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="25" data-line-end="26"><strong>Number Properties</strong> - Since we didn’t utilize Number Methods in many exercises, I still feel like I need more practice.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="26" data-line-end="27">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="26" data-line-end="27"><strong>Javascript Syntax</strong> - I feel that this quarter gave more importance to the script/code of javascript, which is why I’m still not as experienced on where to place and how to use external elements.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="27" data-line-end="29">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="27" data-line-end="28"><strong>Javascript Input Statements</strong> - Similarly to my issue for Javascript syntax, I still need more practice when dealing with the aspects of javascript that show up as elements on a website.</p>
</li>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="29" data-line-end="30"><strong>Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items:</strong></p>

<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="30" data-line-end="32">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="30" data-line-end="31">Finding external tools/resources to better understand the lessons I don’t understand very well.</p>

<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="32" data-line-end="34">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="32" data-line-end="33">Coding in my spare time, so I can get used to other elements of javascript outside of the script portion.</p>

<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="34" data-line-end="36">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="34" data-line-end="35">Consulting with my CS teacher to clear up any misconceptions regarding these lessons.</p>

<ol>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="39" data-line-end="41">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="39" data-line-end="40"><strong>Kahoot Games</strong> - I enjoyed these games, as they made learning the subject more engaging and approachable, while still feeling tense and competitive due the leaderboard and scoring system.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="41" data-line-end="43">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="41" data-line-end="42"><strong>Speed Tests</strong> - These speed tests helped me gauge my understanding on the given topic, while keeping me motivated to finish them quickly and efficiently due to the bonus points being given for early completion.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="43" data-line-end="44"><strong>Not Effective:</strong></p>
<ol start="3">
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="44" data-line-end="46">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="44" data-line-end="45"><strong>Diagnostic/Pretests</strong> - I don’t feel like these helped me assess my current knowledge on the topic, or provided me an idea of what to expect, as they feel misleading and may give a result that might not be my true understanding of the material.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="46" data-line-end="47">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="46" data-line-end="47"><strong>Sessions purely consisting of discussion</strong> - I don’t enjoy these sessions as I don’t feel engaged with the lesson, especially due to CS being more application oriented rather than discussion oriented.</p>
